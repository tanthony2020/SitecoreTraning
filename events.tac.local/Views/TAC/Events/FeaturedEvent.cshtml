            Hike one of the most beautiful mountain landscapes in the world. Italy’s dramatic rocky rooftop, the Dolomites offer spectacular views and lovely surroundings, especially on this spring tour. You will enjoy the wild Alpine meadows, snow-tipped peaks and cobblestone mountain villages. We will take scenic paths from Cortina d’ Ampezzo to Alta   Badia and learn about the fascinating history of the region along the way.
